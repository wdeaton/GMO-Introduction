# Genetically Modified Organisms

The topic for this blog is going to be about the specifics of what GMOs are. Hopefully this clarifies what GMOs are, how they came about, how they are made, and a general history of them. My challenging goal is to make this blog informative and unbiased. There is much debate about GMOs and I do not want to have a debate in this blog. We are specifically going to dive into what GMOs are. The last blog will be my opinions of GMOs after all my research, but first, we need to understand GMOs. To understand what GMOs are, one must know what GMO means. GMO stands for genetically modified organisms. Typically, this is when you take desired genes from one organism and insert them into another organism. GMOs have been around for quite some time now and there are many kinds of GMOs out there today!

So, when you are ready, let us dive in!
